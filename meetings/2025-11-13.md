## Admin stuff
- NumFOCUS CoC [PR 8320](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8320)
    - We chose to have the CoC Working Group give us recommendations and we make the final decisions. That was the main decision needed by numfocus. Next step is to update our github, docs, social media, events.
    - Questions/comments/discussion?
- NumFOCUS leadership votes. Our votes get combined to equal one sponsored project's input. Let's coordinate. Probably best to have one person actualy do the vote.
    -  Dan has registered to vote via the NetworkX project. 
 
## Topics

- Release 3.6
  * Release docs updates 
  * No complaints from the RC *tada*
  * Let's get a full release out -- @mridul should "do it" and we could be there via zoom if that would help.

- [TODO] nx-parallel release with next networkx release

- Refactor nx.draw to [use display under-the-hood PR 8255](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8255)
    - any concerns on this approach for NX 3.6? (probably wait for 3.7)
    - run drawing heavy suites from outside the tests:
        - gallery
        - nx-guides
    - how does iplotx play into this if at all?


### Action Items
- Webpage and translations: Jarrod held off from updating the webpage though. He says "But the translations on the main page look like they are going to make releases more difficult if we want to keep the translations up to date." Where do we stand on this issue? Are there discussions on the website repo PRs or Issues that discuss how to update the webpages?
    - Jarrod updated the webpage to v3.5 without the translations.
    - Let's continue the discussion of how to maintain translations. Numpy has English for v2.2 while translations are only for v1.26.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - Updates:
        - Fabio is encouraged by our feedback and is close to switching to focus intently on docs and tests. **Summary of following quote:** Create issues on iplotx for any suggestions so he can remember them.
        - take a look at [the "styles" docs](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html)
        - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 


## Old Topics
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
- Manually replace functions with useful errormessages by tweaking `getattr`. Let's try to do this with removed functions that have replacements. (Add docs for developers about this to the deprecation handling part of dev docs.)
