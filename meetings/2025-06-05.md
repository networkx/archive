### News and Welcome
- NetworkX 3.5 has been released!

## Upcoming meetings and events
- [dispatching](https://hackmd.io/rqs_pWMxSLmICXCpI3w-Ug) Monthly meetings on the first Tuesday of each month.
- PyData London June 6-8th (Mridul talk)
- Scipy 2025 (Erik & Ralph talk and poster)

### Action Items
- (technical Q) `deploy-docs` uses Python 3.11. The [PR #8102](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8102) ups that to Python 3.12 to accomodate nx-parallel requiring 3.12+. Is this OK? Any reason nx-parallel should reduce its dependency to 3.11 instead?
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) draft version for comments. Examples: A [somewhat complex example](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/plot_complex.html) and [the current gallery of plots](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html).
  - Let's take a look at the style system presented. Would it make sense to have default ways to look up values that are not assigned in the style dict?
  - Are there other aspects of drawing we would want to include? 
    - Some feedback:
            - The self-loops look better!
            - The syntax makes use of the style elements being stored on the graph. At least if they are on the graph it makes the syntax easy to point to them. It also looks like storing them separately from the graph works too. 
            - Let's check how storing style elements as arrays also works (old style drawing).
- Webpage and translations: Jarrod held off from updating the webpage though. He says "But the translations on the main page look like they are going to make releases more difficult if we want to keep the translations up to date." Where do we stand on this issue? Are there discussions on the website repo PRs or Issues that discuss how to update the webpages?
    - Jarrod updated the webpage to v3.5 without the translations.
    - Let's continue the discussion of how to maintain translations. Numpy has English for v2.2 while translations are only for v1.26.

## Topics
- ordered nodes, and a clearly stated contract about ordered nodes. [PR 8071](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8071) and many others. 
    - one motivating issue from `optimize_edit_paths` [Issue 8054](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8054)
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc). 
- chordal graphs, elimination orders, etc.
    - what is alpha used for other than an ordering. Why not return a list for the ordering?
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
