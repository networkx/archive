### Followup - Pypi org governance

## Topics

- Increase in auto-genned AI spam
  * Be on the lookout - don't waste your review time!
  * What to do about it?

- Linting
  * [#7877](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7877) was good IMO, but contributor deleted their branch :upside_down_face: 
      - can we recreate with something like `ruff check --select=PERF401`?
  * Docstring line length - I think I figured it out: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7938
    * Discussion points:
      - What should the character limit be (I chose 110)
      - Applies to docstrings + comments - is that okay?
      - `pprint` pattern for doctests
      - Doesn't autofix - is that a blocker?

- Cytoscape JS
  - A couple users are confused - should we change how we handle this?
    * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7913

- "Motif-finding" in graphs
  * Don't know what the right terminology is... what algorithms exist?
  * Related to subgraph isomorphism?
  * E.g. proposal for more motifs: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7836

- revamp and improve `spring_layout`.  The PR ads a "method" kwarg to select "auto", dense and sparse with the sparse being the new and improved version.
  - Updates since last week
    

- Identity tests fail on dispatched test suite
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7904
  - Perhaps not surprising, what should be done?  Let's try to find a easy way to mark within the tests that we don't want this part of the test to be done for backends.

- Visualization PRs:
    - [PR #7589 Introducing the new_draw API](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7589)
        - One approval: Let's do this one so we can build other structure before 3.5
        - Moving forward:
            - go into the examples gallery and rewrite to use the "save attributes on the graph" formalism.
            - extend docs.
            - work with igraph viz tools to provide support for NX

- GSoC 
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/7882 
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7899
    - Someone interested in “Pedagogical Interactive Notebooks for Algorithms”
    - There may be other Gsoc related PRs in [nx-parallel](https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel/pulls)

- Conversion from dataframe support: pandas, polars, xarray (oh my!)
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/7842
  - polars works in the pandas functions -- we should add a newly named function with DataFrame in the name. (Other options discussed too, but this seems best.)
  - Waiting for a PR.
  
- Floating point errors: should we do something about this?
    - better warnings in docs
    - add tools to convert to integers
    - add kwargs to indicate rounding level for converting
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/7868
    - ideas? epsilon, mpmath

- Beef up the glossary?
  - https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/glossary.html
  - add more terms with code to test whether that feature holds
  - terms like vertex_cover or approximation could be added with description of how we handle
  - Needs a PR.

- PyGraphviz progress is being made -- almost have wheels.
  - Update: rossbar has bitten the bullet and bought a windows machine - hope to receive by early next week
  - Conversation with graphviz folks: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1890#note_2343051171
    - With wheels release pygraphviz 2.0, we are testing with python 3.11.  We should maybe bump that down to 3.10 for the 2.0 release. So there will be one set of wheels for Python 3.10.
    
- PRs and concepts aiming for v3.5
    - [PR #7589 Introducing the new_draw API](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7589)
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7908
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7918


- Isomorphism matching functions 
    - Matching functions work for isomorphism problems, not monomorphism. Add monomorphism matching functions? Put examples in docs?
        - leave there but add to docs and change docs to include the making of the matching functions rather than using the built-in ones. Get people used to the idea of making their own.
        - for this Issue, we can add an example for using the monomorphism.

- Benchmarking CI job
    * Future Goals/Issues/Questions:
        * put benchmarking docs in the docs somewhere. 
            * one approach could be to have the benchmarks run say weekly with results being a table ot plot-image that could be added to the docs.
        * One real advantage of this is a standardize set of benchmarks to compare backends. To make that work fully we need to know more than just what algorithm is run, but how it is run (parameters, options, etc)
        * Using the cloud backend with containers adds another layer of variability. It would be nice to be able to say "I want to run this on my specific set of compute features".
    * nxbench https://github.com/dPys/nxbench/
    * nxbench docs: https://dpys.github.io/nxbench/main/index.html
    * links to cugraph pages
        - Landing page https://rapids.ai/nx-cugraph/ 
        - Colab page showing nx-cugraph https://nvda.ws/4drM4re
    * Need to get a minimal example for why the rendering wasn't working at the Summit for Rick's installation. 
    * now feature complete -- Take a look! 
        * setup is via yaml files
        * Can add new tests. 6-7 tests so far. need more
        * Can add new backends.
        * Additions use python functions which provides lots of flexibility  
        * asv now swapped out in favor of docker/dask/prefect tools.
        * Hardware/Compute:
            * Ross may be able to provide hardware for further exploration.
            * AWS time available to academics, via NX small dev grant payments, and possibly AWS programs for OSS. 
            * NVIDIA may be able to provide some resource (but maybe not)
    * Comments/suggestions/wishes etc can be listed by opening [an Issue on github](https://github.com/dPys/nxbench/issues)
    * nxbench is good for comparing with backends. What about comparing between commits/regression analysis.
        * It'd be good to dump timing data regularly somewhere we can host. And putting it into the docs at some point.
        * hardware can be coming from Ross's lab.

- Updating the landing page 
    - translation should continue regardless of what theme we use as content should separate from theme.
    - What are next steps here if any?  
        - introduce Hugo theme to NX landing page
        - move to whatever myst theme the ecosystem moves to when it gets developed
        - translation should be able to happen anywhere along the way.

- [SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/)
    - "Note that endorsing doesn’t mean we have to implement or follow everything, just that we endorse and recommend this practice for the wider ecosystem. We may chose to not implement something because it doesn’t make sense for us."
    - [SPEC 7: pseudorandom handling](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0007/)
        - How does this handle default rngs?
            - [Dan] my understand is that `RandomState` is only needed when a "forever" bit stream must be guaranteed. So we need `rng=np.random.RandomState(42)` to work. But no other cases should use RandomState.
            - `default_rng` should be default. `int` should give `default_rng(int)`. If `Generator` or `RandomsState` instance, use it.
        - An understated part of this SPEC is that its implementation currently doesn't allow folks to use RandomState after the removal of the kwargs for randomstate.

- Visualization:
    - Visualization Tool: Fabio Zanini is interested in rewriting/repackaging his work on igraph to a drawing package for both igraph and networkx. The present version currently  has backends Cairo and matplotlib.
    - this would provide NX with, e.g., 
        - fast drawing of arrows for large networks,
        - autoupdates when the user zooms in/out,
        - animations, 
        - editable plotting objects, 
        - plotly support
    - timing: Fabio example package in 1st qtr of 2025, followed by feedback, rewriting, integrating with NX, etc.
    - what questions/concerns/suggestions do we have for him?

- `create_using` as hook for external graph implementations
    - TODO: write this as a mentorable project
        - Let's make it a fairly detailed Issue that describes finding all generators without a create_using arg and add it to them.
        - The implementation of NXEP3 is more policy driven then implementation and would likely not be good for a new contributor.
    * If users have external `Graph` that implement the subset of methods necessary for various generators in NetworkX, they should be able to pass their class into `create_using` and get one of their objects out
        * See e.g. [#5762](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5672) for the random_graph generators. Merged :tada:
        - Supporting this adds a little boilerplate on NX's end; i.e. needing to check whether `create_using` is directed/multi for creation functions that don't support those types. Here's an [example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/409979eff35f02eff54f4eea3731736bd431dc2e/networkx/generators/classic.py#L547-L551). #5762 created a helper function [check_create_using](https://github.com/tillahoffmann/networkx/blob/b11c8fdd0934645c14ebe88b17f4b461d0e4b5e7/networkx/utils/misc.py#L604) in utils.py to do this processing so it is easy to implement across all random_graph.py functions.
        - Still need to:
          * wrap this boilerplate into a decorator similar to `not_implemented_for`.
          * Don't need to handle all of these in one giant PR! But maybe could... :)
- Should we raise a NetworkXError instead of a ValueError.
      - Should write that down somewhere (in developer guide?)
      - If error nx is creating, it's an NXError (vs SciPy, re-using ValueError, e.g.)
      - Some exceptions such as NodeNotFound, NXPointlessConcept etc (which is a very specific defined term that shouldn't easily be expanded)
- pygraphviz: Felipe from [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/pygraphviz-feedstock) has gotten us setup with `cibuildwheel` :rocket: 
  * Will merge after next pygraphviz release (early October)
  * Update?
- Tools:
    - Low priority update: typing
      - https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub
    - PyPy
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2259
        - PyPy 3.11 not available
            - https://github.com/pypy/pypy/milestone/15


### Dispatch Topic
- normalization seems to be wrong in betweenness_centrality when endpoints are included or not(?).  There may have been a previous issue involved with going over 1 for normalizaed BC. 
- Docs and Tests
- Adding runtime hooks for callbacks
- Making graph classes dispatchable
    - could dispatch from a function like empty_graph
    - ??bundle it in generator rather than classes
- [SPEC 2 on Dispatching](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0002/) updated!! Thanks Aditi!!
- [Issue #7623](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7623) to separate graph input validation from algorithms?
- [open dispatching PRs:](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ADispatching)
    - prioritized list from dispatch meeting: #7485 #7528 #7294 #7259.     There are more comments and info in the [dispatch meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/rqs_pWMxSLmICXCpI3w-Ug)
    - Merged [#7585](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7585)! :Tada:


## Collect Ideas for 4.0
- Should we start naming new modules with a leading underscore? This would simplify tab-completion by hiding modules.
- Restructure namespace: Review public interface: For v4.0 we should be looking at the import structure?  Some subpackages are not imported to the main namespace. We have decided that based on history of how they were first committed. Is there a good way to decide which should require an extra referal: `network.community.modularity` instead of `networkx.modularity`?
    - nx.dag might be a place to see how much churn  would entail.
  - First decision: what do we *want* the interface to be?
  - Module/pkg `__dir__` provides a nice way to modify discoverability of modules/packages **without** breaking existing code
  - NX-guide idea: model/visualize the package as a DAG (thanks Matt!)
- Generators revamp as per NXEP 3
  * [NXEP 3] Graph Builders and Generators (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/developer/nxeps/nxep-0003.rst)
    * [June 14] How to handle the docs for two functions nx.path_graph and nx.path_graph_generator
    * [June 14] Do we have a decorator create two functions in the main namespace? Or just hardcode the two functions in the module? Ideas on cutting down duplication of code/effort?
    * We should have a conversation about how dispatching should interact with these graph builders.
    * Rewritten Text merged! :tada: in [#6648](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6648)
    * Maybe make private functions that are generators. Could start now. Could be used to see how much impact it has on speed, memory use, etc. We can test it out privately and see what are the advantages. 
    * Motivation to make these changes for random graphs: [#5672](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5672) requests `create_using` arg for random graph generators so that subclass of Graph can be built by the generator
- Temporal Graphs
- Hyper Graphs
- Universal binary graph storage
    - Let's look at Arrow
    - Also look at binsparse
    - [Graphtool's binary format](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/gt_format.html)

### Possible (mentored) Projects
 
- To make contributions of new centrality algorithms more compelling, it would be helpful to have a large set of tests showing what are the expected values and how it is different from other measures of centrality. [add this discussion result to the contributors FAQ] (@rossbar)
- For centrality, a mentored project could test and document the various centrality measures and their differences on a suite of graphs. [add to list in the docs!]
- Visualization features/improvements
  * Marker intersection PR for drawing [#4601](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4601)

## NXEP Topics
  * We should create an NXEP describing dispatching.
  * Could we add the NXEP status to the documentation page with the list of NXEPs and their titles?  Maybe like: `NXEP 0 - Accepted - Purpose and process`. This might require changes to sphinx/autodoc. Any easy way to annotate within `index.rst` and still allow the autodoc links to be formed? 
  * According to NXEP 0 we should be converting NXEPs that are implemented to the status: Final...  not Accepted. Perhaps a PR to do that for 0, 1, 2 and 4 is in order. 
  * NXEP 4: TODO [name=rossbar] - propose acceptance on mailing list

## Long-term tracking items

  - let's collect a list(s) of network analysis problems that are really good, and that dispatch makes that possible to solve.
      - pypi connections of projects by requirements
      - tools to load datasets from a given url

- Landing Page Translation to multiple written languages. See [networkx-website 21](https://github.com/networkx/website/issues/21) 

- let's try to get a focused sprint for working on NetworkX in the next 4-12 months

- Org-level accounts on PyPi - we have applied, waiting to hear back

  * Submitted April 25, 2023, got confirmation. waiting for authorization. The ["about" item on the pypi organization page](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/) says the program is in "closed beta" at the moment.
  
- Revisiting our pytest `slow` mark: (from near the bottom of this document) 
  * The `slow` tests are run w/ each push/PR in the coverage job; however, it's not necessarily true that the slow tests improve coverage!
  * Could save a lot of CI time by having a separate category (e.g. `pytest.mark.comprehensive`?) that is for tests that are slow but *don't* affect coverage. These could be run less frequently (scheduled job?) and potentially save several minutes for each push
    - General consensus: seems like a good idea
- Other CI-saving ideas
    - All tests should depend on the lint action, so all the other tests fail fast.(Maybe only do this just before a sprint where many tasks could  jam up the CI.)

- nx pkg namesquatting on Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/nx/#description
  * TODO: https://github.com/pypi/support/issues - PEP 541
  * March 27, 2024: dschult emailed team@nx.pub to ask if they are willing to remove the package name from pypi, or transfer it to us.
  * Response: `Alex Doe <alexdoesh@gmail.com>
  * `Just in case, it’s not a name squatting or smth similar, I still work on a project (it’s a strict/static python aot compiler to webassembly, no interpreter) and hope to release it publicly this year. In case of inability to do so, I will notify you. Thank you and have a great day.`
  * So I think we should wait till 2025 and then contact again.

SPECS
-----
  - [SPEC 7: random seeding](https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/pull/180#issuecomment-1570678859)
    - We have NXEP-4 to discuss this https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/developer/nxeps/nxep-0004.html
    - Ross will review and coauthor SPEC 7
  
  - https://scientific-python.org/specs/
      - nx endorsed 0, 1, and 4
      - what about the [Accessibility SPEC 3?]( https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0003/) We support the accessibility goals and ideas, but most changes would need to be put in sphinx themes and other upstream tools. How do we support that and what would endorsing the SPEC mean for this topic?

  * Stanford SNAP datasets: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html
  * TAMU sparse: http://sparse.tamu.edu/
    * Note: contains many SNAP datasets

- Do we have any info about what functions are most used/popular?
  * not from the survey - request for next iteration!
  * Guen (@guenp) is working with Matt (@mdhaber) on telemetry
  * We could look at networkx itself to see how often individual functions are called in the codebase itself
    * Jim Pivarski (@jpivarski) is working on a tool that would help with this at the May 2023 developer summit. Results?

- TODO from [igraph meeting](https://igraph.org/workshop.html) (June 21-22)
  - Group will be formed, e.g. "network science software sustainability group"
     * Convince other organizations/conferences to contribute to OSS Network software
  - Met graphtool dev, igraph devs, gephi
    * It'd be nice to have a list of github handles for folks from different communities
      - e.g. the gephi folks are GEXF experts, it'd be great to know who to ping!
  - Discussions on file format standarization for graph data (i.e. json-like)
  - Leiden is awesome
  - Basic dispatching discussion: topical discussion, folks are aware
  - More cross-community coordination to come!

- Teams Changes:
  - What else needs to be done with Teams changes? 
  Anybody else to add? Changes to "owners"?
    * 3 proposed teams [not agreed upon yet]:
      - maintainers (with commit rights)
      - triage (with triage rights)
      - emeritus (no active rights)
    * vs keep current teams and governance documents and just update the role for core developer from triage to write  [decided to switch to write access] Updated the core team too and removed emeritus owners.

- Adopt `pyproject.toml`?
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6774 (merged)
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6780 (merged)
  - https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/pull/471

- Best Practices for NX?
  - helpful to have a place for best-practices like nbunch, view vs dict, subgraph vs subgraph.copy()
  * nx-guides would be a good place for this!

- Keyword-only and maybe position-only input. Candidate subpackage to start changing code to keyword-only is the nx_pylab. (see [SLEP009](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep009/proposal.html) for how sklearn did this)

- We should try to automate the release process as much as possible so that we could remove a human from the release process. conda-forge has a very automated release system. Would a SPEC covering automated releases be reasonable?
    - Not clear what the advanatges of automating the release process would be. The process is [documented](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/developer/release.rst) What would make this better?
    - Why would automating things further not cause problems?
    - That's agree to make sure a PR's title is helpful and descriptive before merging it.

- VIZ keywords arrows, arrowstyle, connectionstyle. Can we improve this interface? [#5694](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5694) and a link to the [current interface](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/2c904d18dc79df3acd64495ef64c6ff4674992a0/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py#L537)
    - Now raise UserWarnings when users request features that are not available for the underlying edge-viz object (e.g. LineCollection)
    - Is there a better, more wholistic solution?
    - Need to indicate:
      o FancyArrowPatch or LineCollection
      o The arrowstyle (head or not or both, etc)
      o The connectionstyle (arc bendable etc)
    - Maybe changing the name of `arrows` to `fancyedges` would help
    - New logic could be:  If non-default value for either arrowstyle or connectionstyle then switch to FancyArrowPatch.

- Property-based testing
  * Check out `hypothesis` for setting up property-based testing
  * Developing good property-based tests:
    - Reference "naive" (but correct) implementation
    - Generate random graphs, evaluate them for the property you want
    - Pump these through the naive implementation and collect interesting cases for test suite

- Temporal networks: how to think about these
  * seems to be a lot of interest from different communities, but no standard approach yet...
  * Having a use-case to drive the design of a data structure would be good
  
- nx-guides
  * We need a contributor guide :book: [name=Mridul]
  * Dependency management for tutorials - how to strike a balance between tools people use and maintainability

- New contributors
  * So many good students/contributions - how do we keep the ball rolling (even if we can only accept 1 or a subset of them for this round)
    - Add something to contributor guide about where to look for good issues (e.g. add missing docstring examples)
    - Link to [first issue tag](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/labels/Good%20First%20Issue) on github?
