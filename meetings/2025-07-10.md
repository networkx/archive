- EuroSciPy 2025 (18-22 Aug): Aditi and Sebastian talk

## Topics
- `nx.draw(G, pos=pos)` makes it "easy" to use different position dicts. What is a replacement for that with display?
  ```
  # np.spring_layout(G, store_pos_as="pos_spring")
  nx.add_node_attributes(G, pos, "pos_spring")
  nx.display(G, pos="pos_spring")
  ```
    - does `nx.display(G, pos=pos)` work?

- A* algorithms - rossbar laid out opinion on those stale PRs
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7965#issuecomment-3053379335
  * No action items, just wanted to make folks aware in case you want to get another perspective onto the thread!

- `prefix_tree` updates and ideas
  * Got these ideas from building prefix tree's for [left truncatable primes](https://oeis.org/A024785) for `nx-guides`
  1. Make the attribute name where data is stored configurable
     - Already PR: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8136
  2. Make NIL sentinel node optional (no PR yet)
     - Currently, `prefix_tree` adds a sentinel node (NIL) that connects to all of the "leaves" in the tree. The idea is that it makes it easier to reconstruct all input paths, but it makes it so the tree is not an arborescence (which would be the naive expectation). This is all documented, but I wonder if an option to disable that (i.e. `leaf_sentinel=None`) wouldn't be helpful

- New functionality proposal: iterator over unique triangles
  * Do folks think this would be useful? It struck me as interesting
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8135

- TODO: update [betweenness_centrality gallery example](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/algorithms/plot_parallel_betweenness.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-algorithms-plot-parallel-betweenness-py) with nx-parallel


## Last week: follow-up?
- SPEC 7: Scientific Python Ecosystem coordination for random number API
- Walks, trails, and paths in NetworkX
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8123
- `is_reachable`: can we construct the `two_neighbor` results without searching the entire graph?
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8112
- Strong perfect graph theorem
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8111
- Corollary: minimum-len cycle detection - anyone know of any algorithms?
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8128
- Minute detail in FR implementation leads to interesting visualizations+discussion about force-directed layouts!
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8113
  * this animation might be a good gallery example
  * also good mention in the spring_layout docs that increasing the number of iterations can help a lot with layout quality for larger graphs.
- pytest-mpl Should we turn it on generally? (probably yes)
- Review PRs in reverse chronological order. 


### Action Items
- Webpage and translations: Jarrod held off from updating the webpage though. He says "But the translations on the main page look like they are going to make releases more difficult if we want to keep the translations up to date." Where do we stand on this issue? Are there discussions on the website repo PRs or Issues that discuss how to update the webpages?
    - Jarrod updated the webpage to v3.5 without the translations.
    - Let's continue the discussion of how to maintain translations. Numpy has English for v2.2 while translations are only for v1.26.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - Updates:
        - Fabio is encouraged by our feedback and is close to switching to focus intently on docs and tests. **Summary of following quote:** Create issues on iplotx for any suggestions so he can remember them.
        - take a look at [the "styles" docs](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html)
        - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc). 


## Old Topics
- chordal graphs, elimination orders, etc.
    - what is alpha used for other than an ordering. Why not return a list for the ordering?
    - Alpha dict is supposed to be a perfect elimination ordering. We will remove the alpha feature and just return the ordering as a list.
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
- Manually replace functions with useful errormessages by tweaking `getattr`. Let's try to do this with removed functions that have replacements. (Add docs for developers about this to the deprecation handling part of dev docs.)
