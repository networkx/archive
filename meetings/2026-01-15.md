## Meeting Info
- Meeting time Thursdays 12-1 ET (5pm UTC)
- [dispatching meeting](https://hackmd.io/rqs_pWMxSLmICXCpI3w-Ug) 1st Tuesday of the month 11:30-12:30 ET 
- [Publicly available analytics for our docs pages](https://views.scientific-python.org/networkx.org)

**In attendance**: Ross, Mridul, Erik, Dan, Rick

## Admin stuff
- Nice freethreading docs overview: https://py-free-threading.github.io/
    - Other things to keep track of:
        - threading control outside of NX. Hopefully Python makes this possible/typical.
 
## Topics
- Agent PRs
  * Adopting scikit-learn policy: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8468. Additional discussion?
  * rossbar plans to implement policy soon - any objections?
    - i.e. close PRs, not ban folks!

- Callable `weight`/`capacity` for flow/path finding funcs
  * Lot's of activity over the past month - any quick summary?
  * Make sure to check this before next release, e.g. in floyd-warshall

- [parallel doc build in CI: #8344](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8344)
  * It's been in for ~2months - no stability issues (so far)
  * Also no significant speedups (need parallel examples for that)

- Other doc issues: [Football gallery example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8419)
  - Link to football data is kaput; can we intern/mirror it?

- CI gotcha: order of operations of installs borks environment
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8469

- A few chordal things
  * Proposal to speedup `is_chordal`: works for small graphs, but gets worse for large graphs!
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8408
    * Other interesting things from this PR:
      1. Potential for replacing some "private" functions (e.g. use `nx.density` instead of `_is_complete_graph`)
      2. Algorithm for generating all non-isomorphic connected chordal graphs with `n` nodes?
  * Self-loop semantics: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8471
  * Careful review catches rossbar's misunderstanding of set semantics!
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8470

- [walk creator #8383](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8383) Should this create one walk for each starting node? Or one walk for the prescribed node. Difference is looping in the function or outside the function -- and are the nodes the likely loop?

- Thoughts about deprecating `minimum_cut_value` and `maximum_flow_value`? https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8393

- [TODO] nx-parallel release with next networkx release

- Refactor nx.draw to [use display under-the-hood PR 8255](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8255)
    - run drawing heavy suites from outside the tests:
        - gallery
        - nx-guides
- Probably should Update docs to point to iplotx and/or display as needed. (Action: open an issue)

### Action Items
- We should help out contributors who have a single function optimization for their use-case. Probably by making backends with one function easy to use/share/morph.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 


## Old Topics
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
