## Upcoming meetings and events
- Scipy 2025 (Erik)
- EuroSciPy 2025 (18-22 Aug): Aditi and Sebastian talk

## Topics
- `nx.display` signature
  * Currently uses the `**kwargs` pattern
  * Misalignment between documented and implemented parameter names (see e.g. [gh-8153](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8153))
  * Can we make signature explicit? Downside of doing so?
    - It's a bit trickier than normal keyword arguments, because there are almost two sets of defaults: 1 for the attribute name on the graph, and a second for what happens when that attribute isn't found! Could we handle these two defaults gracefully with a "normal" signature using kwargs?
    - Also what about the classic pattern `argname=None`? How would we want to handle that?

- `generate_random_paths` (should be walks)
  * Motivation for a `target` parameter - is it something we want to support?
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8014#issuecomment-3061789527

- `is_reachable`
  * Great work on the rewrite + benchmarks are very useful!
  * I re-requested dschult's approval since things had changed significantly since last approval (no more numpy)
  * The development arc here reminds me of some lessons from [From Python to Numpy](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/#table-of-contents), particularly Ch. 5 and 7.1!

- pytest-mpl tests in CI: how to organize
  * Current state of affairs: `--mpl` tests only run in circleci
    - Motivation: circleci saves the artifacts, so the visual results of mpl test failures are viewable in the browser
  * Proposal to add `--mpl` tests to GH actions as well

- webpage translations and updates during release cycle. (discussion with Jarrod present)

- loopback testing errors (we only run the tests with 3.10). Brought up because of [Issue #8115](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8115)
  * TODOs:
    1. Add a scheduled (cron) job to github actions to run the dispatching tests with the full suite of Python versions (and maybe OS'es too)
    2. Look at updated environment info just posted in 8115 to see if we can't generate a reproducer on a machine with both Python 3.10 and GPU(s)


## Older Topics for reference
- SPEC 7: Scientific Python Ecosystem coordination for random number API
- Walks, trails, and paths in NetworkX
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8123
- `is_reachable`: can we construct the `two_neighbor` results without searching the entire graph?
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8112
- Strong perfect graph theorem
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8111
- Corollary: minimum-len cycle detection - anyone know of any algorithms?
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8128
- Minute detail in FR implementation leads to interesting visualizations+discussion about force-directed layouts!
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8113
  * this animation might be a good gallery example
  * also good mention in the spring_layout docs that increasing the number of iterations can help a lot with layout quality for larger graphs.
- pytest-mpl Should we turn it on generally? (probably yes)
- Review PRs in reverse chronological order. 


### Action Items
- Webpage and translations: Jarrod held off from updating the webpage though. He says "But the translations on the main page look like they are going to make releases more difficult if we want to keep the translations up to date." Where do we stand on this issue? Are there discussions on the website repo PRs or Issues that discuss how to update the webpages?
    - Jarrod updated the webpage to v3.5 without the translations.
    - Let's continue the discussion of how to maintain translations. Numpy has English for v2.2 while translations are only for v1.26.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - Updates:
        - Fabio is encouraged by our feedback and is close to switching to focus intently on docs and tests. **Summary of following quote:** Create issues on iplotx for any suggestions so he can remember them.
        - take a look at [the "styles" docs](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html)
        - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc). 


## Old Topics
- chordal graphs, elimination orders, etc.
    - what is alpha used for other than an ordering. Why not return a list for the ordering?
    - Alpha dict is supposed to be a perfect elimination ordering. We will remove the alpha feature and just return the ordering as a list.
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
- Manually replace functions with useful errormessages by tweaking `getattr`. Let's try to do this with removed functions that have replacements. (Add docs for developers about this to the deprecation handling part of dev docs.)
