## Admin stuff
- NumFOCUS CoC meeting with NX core devs. Who wants to be there?

- PyPi NetworkX Organization:
    - Do we want to do anything with our PyPi Org?

## Topics

- SPEC 0 schedule: https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/#support-window
  * Could in principle bump min ver for numpy/scipy to 2.0, 12.0 respectively
  * Motivation for numpy < 2?
  
- CI situation update
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8297
  * Series of proposed CI improvements:
    - Make debugging easier: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8301
    - Improve performance of animations: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8291
    - Limit num cores and redundancy in parallel example: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8305

- ISMAGs update: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8274
  
- Prepping for release
  * Anything we want in?
    * rossbar's wants:
      - ISMAGs
      - `random_k_lift` (give or take module location)
      - `metric_closure` deprecation

- https://github.com/conda-forge/networkx-feedstock/issues/69

- add nx-neptune: any follow-up discussion?
  - see: https://github.com/awslabs/nx-neptune/pull/36
  - Should we have a little more control of what goes into the NX docs? How much should a backend be able to put into the NX docs?
  - We don't want to require a backend to have complete API docs for each function. 

- [TODO] nx-parallel release with next networkx release

- Refactor nx.draw to [use display under-the-hood](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8255)
    - any concerns on this approach for NX 3.6? (probably wait for 3.7)
    - run drawing heavy suites from outside the tests:
        - gallery
        - nx-guides
    - how does iplotx play into this if at all?

- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc). 

### Action Items
- Webpage and translations: Jarrod held off from updating the webpage though. He says "But the translations on the main page look like they are going to make releases more difficult if we want to keep the translations up to date." Where do we stand on this issue? Are there discussions on the website repo PRs or Issues that discuss how to update the webpages?
    - Jarrod updated the webpage to v3.5 without the translations.
    - Let's continue the discussion of how to maintain translations. Numpy has English for v2.2 while translations are only for v1.26.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - Updates:
        - Fabio is encouraged by our feedback and is close to switching to focus intently on docs and tests. **Summary of following quote:** Create issues on iplotx for any suggestions so he can remember them.
        - take a look at [the "styles" docs](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html)
        - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 


## Old Topics
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
- Manually replace functions with useful errormessages by tweaking `getattr`. Let's try to do this with removed functions that have replacements. (Add docs for developers about this to the deprecation handling part of dev docs.)
