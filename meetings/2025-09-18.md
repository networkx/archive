## Topics

- add nx-neptune: any follow-up discussion?
  - see: https://github.com/awslabs/nx-neptune/pull/36
  - Should we have a little more control of what goes into the NX docs? How much should a backend be able to put into the NX docs?
  - We don't want to require a backend to have complete API docs for each function. 

- [TODO] nx-parallel release with next networkx release

- Refactor nx.draw to [use display under-the-hood](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8255)
    - any concerns on this approach for NX 3.6? (probably wait for 3.7)
    - run drawing heavy suites from outside the tests:
        - gallery
        - nx-guides
    - how does iplotx play into this if at all?

- State of the "topological" generators (k-lift, slimfly, projective polarity graphs)
    - [random_k_lift](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8045) Should this be in operator, or generator? With `random` at front or just `k_lift`?
        - Is `H = nx.k_lift(G, k)` like `nx.power(G, k)` or `nx.complement(G)` which are in algorithms under `operators.py`? Or is it like `nx.stochastic_graph(G)` or `nx.line_graph(G)` which are in generators?
        - [projective polarity graph generator]( https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8066)
- We should go through the old PRs that Aric looked through and *did not* decide should just be thrown out.

- ISMAGS: Adds support for directed and multigraphs. Also refactors the recursive mtehods as DFSs, and corrects a couple of bugs, but leaves at least one other not resolved (how to track part correspondence between "top" and "bottom" partitions while refining them.)

- Coverage-related activities update
  * Moving `runslow` out of coverage job
    - Most of the missing coverage related to `test_all_random_functions` tests

- Edge coloring: distinct from node-coloring on line graphs? [no... equivalent to, but more efficient algorithms can be used than (make line_graph, apply node coloring). Still, most effort is typically given to node coloring.]
    - could use line_graph method as comparison with edge_coloring tech

### Action Items
- Webpage and translations: Jarrod held off from updating the webpage though. He says "But the translations on the main page look like they are going to make releases more difficult if we want to keep the translations up to date." Where do we stand on this issue? Are there discussions on the website repo PRs or Issues that discuss how to update the webpages?
    - Jarrod updated the webpage to v3.5 without the translations.
    - Let's continue the discussion of how to maintain translations. Numpy has English for v2.2 while translations are only for v1.26.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - Updates:
        - Fabio is encouraged by our feedback and is close to switching to focus intently on docs and tests. **Summary of following quote:** Create issues on iplotx for any suggestions so he can remember them.
        - take a look at [the "styles" docs](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html)
        - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc). 


## Old Topics
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
- Manually replace functions with useful errormessages by tweaking `getattr`. Let's try to do this with removed functions that have replacements. (Add docs for developers about this to the deprecation handling part of dev docs.)
