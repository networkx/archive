## Admin stuff
- NumFOCUS leadership votes. Our votes get combined to equal one sponsored project's input.
    -  Dan registered and then voted for the NetworkX project. Results will be announced Dec 15.

- Nice freethreading docs overview: https://py-free-threading.github.io/
 
## Topics

- Release 3.6.1
    - Released from main as we often do with minor point releases.
    - Any stories to tell? Broke Backend testing with cugraph. nx-cugraph uses strict function signature checking. 

- [TODO] nx-parallel release with next networkx release

- Refactor nx.draw to [use display under-the-hood PR 8255](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8255)
    - run drawing heavy suites from outside the tests:
        - gallery
        - nx-guides
- Probably should Update docs to point to iplotx and/or display as needed. (Action: open an issue)

### Action Items
- We should help out contributors who have a single function optimization for their use-case. Probably by making backends with one function easy to use/share/morph.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 


## Old Topics
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
