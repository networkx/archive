### Aside about Meeting Notes:
Last long meeting note: [2025-04-11.md](https://github.com/networkx/archive/blob/main/meetings/2025-04-11.md). Now meeting notes are short.

Note: if you have trouble with the "new" requirement of authenicating with zoom before joining the meeting, let Dan know. It's purpose is to deny access to the bot: "Warren's AI Notetaker"

### Action Items
- release 3.5?
    - Check pydot release from 3.0 to 4.0. It broke some stuff. We should check that we have that all working.
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc).

## Topics
- `is_aperiodic` semantics
  * Connected components, self loops
    - [PR 8021](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8021) some broken aspects of `is_aperiodic`
- chordal graphs, elimination orders, etc.
- translations: 
    - Spanish and Portuguese, Brazilian translations merged :tada:
    - deploying when push to main would require giving write access (to push to remote repo) to PAT by @jarrodmillman: https://github.com/networkx/website/pull/30#issuecomment-2853371750
        - do we want to deploy when push to main in `networkx/website`? ("no")
            - preview for PRs branches would be better
            - deploy should be manual only for now!
