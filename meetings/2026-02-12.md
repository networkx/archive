**In attendance**: Dan, Erik, Rick, Ross, Mridul

## Topics
- AI in OSS; drama in matplotlib!
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132
  - https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html

- pygraphviz windows wheels checkup
    - nice approach where command line tools are included in the wheels.
- Nx-MLX fastgraph GPU based graph algorithms (Mridul side project)   MLX code.
- Thoughts on next NetworkX summit?  (from last week listed here)
    - Juneish in Copenhagen or in Greece?
    - Make "topics for the day" approach where we focus on e.g. reducing # of PRs, pygraphviz, etc.
    - list of suymmit topics is at bottom of these agendas
- Random Walks
    - Make a simple function to be used as building block
       - Unweighted, simple graph: 
       - `[node] + [(node := seed.choice(G._adj[node])) for _ in walk_length]`
        - add documentation page that goes through lots of possible uses (start node, multiple walks, length limit, etc
        - For backends, it is usual to request a large chunk of output with less generator style intervention. Let's look at shortest_path routines to see how backedns have handled generators there.
        - example of tricky stop condition without generator: terminate walk with 10% chance each step of walk.
- [Football gallery example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8419)
  - Link to football data is kaput; can we intern/mirror it? 33kb.  put into our code? Or add a repo for small graphs we use in docs?
  - Decision needed (for at least first PR)
      - lets put it in NX and see what thats like
- Refactor nx.draw to [use `display` under-the-hood PR 8255](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8255)
    - run drawing heavy suites from outside the tests:
        - gallery (side-by-side compare of gallery examples)
        - nx-guides (Anything easy for nx-guides?)
- `_build_paths_from_predecessors`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8460
  * Both existing and proposed implementations are hard to understand
    - Can we use dict.popitem to implement LIFO?  (Yes!)
    - might need to do that ourselves as no response
- Re-use of intermediate computations - general approach/policy?
  * e.g. re-using shortest paths dict in closeness_centrality: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8424
  * Other places where this is already done:
    - Re-using eccentricity in other distance_measures 
- Linting 1: any objections to updating linter versions?
  * Tried last night, doesn't change code
  * Can do so with `pre-commit autoupdate` if we're okay using versions instead of hashes
- Linting 2: Enforce `pytest.raises` as context manager?
  * Ruff rule for this: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/legacy-form-pytest-raises/
  - API: Do we want to add `centroid` as an alias to `barycenter` in `distance_measures`?
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8491
- Rich club: how to handle normalization: 
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8485
  * Side quest: is there a closed-form solution or approximation for number of non-isomorphic graphs with given degree sequence?
  * Need to decide how to do the "null model" for normalization
- the Pixi setup in the CI.
    - looks good, makes sense.
    - task runners help alot with this.

## Todo
- Convert `draw` to use `display` under the hood.  Review PR side-by-side comparison of the gallery TOC. Anything easy for nx-guides?
- deprecate bfs_predecessors (see https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8445)
- let's make random_paths funct private.
- Probably should Update docs to point to iplotx and/or display as needed. (Action: open an issue)
- We should help out contributors who have a single function optimization for their use-case. Probably by making backends with one function easy to use/share/morph.

## Old Topics
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks

# Topics for the next summit
- issue/PR triage and closing...
- Day for cuGraph action
- NXEP items
- pygraphviz wheels  and/or 2.0 and compatible with Graphviz
- read-only dicts version of views
- free-threading 
- parallel free-threading/parallel discussions
