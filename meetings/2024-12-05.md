- Numfocus board elections 
    - New Administrative Board members:
        - Julie Krugler Hollek
        - Mridul Seth  :tada:
        - Andy Terrel
    - New Technical Board members:

    - Congrats Mridul! Looks like a good group.
- EEOS funding future: CZI is looking at other ways to use EOSS money to support Open Source. They are considering a joint project with Github to use an "Accelerator" training event that through programming builds a cohort to help develop skills and connections needed to fund open source sustainably. 
    - "It would follow a similar format to previous Accelerators, which includes instruction, workshops, and expert speakers, and funding to facilitate participation. Participants will learn how to enhance their project visibility, attract funding, and know how to bridge the gap between open source projects, institutions, industry actors, and other potential funders."
    - Questions on a survey sent to NetworkX:
        - Are there people in the NetworkX community interested in participating. How many?
        - What kind of timing would we prefer? 1-2 hrs/wk for 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 mos, every other wk for 6 mos?
        - What topics would we like to see in such an accelerator program?
## Upcoming meetings
- Weekly meetings: hackmds for [nx-parallel](https://hackmd.io/vlGWcfRsQF64OTIm7bCtpw) and [dispatching](https://hackmd.io/rqs_pWMxSLmICXCpI3w-Ug)
- NetworkX Summit tentative planning: Feb? 2025, UC Berkeley.
- [PyData Global 2024](https://pydata.org/global2024/) (online) - Dec 3-5, 2024. Aditi : [talk - "Understanding API Dispatching in NetworkX"](https://global2024.pydata.org/cfp/talk/V8BYBM/)

## Topics

- Visualization Tool: Fabio Zanini is interested in rewriting/repackaging his work on igraph to a drawing package for both igraph and networkx. The present version currently  has backends Cairo and matplotlib.
    - this would provide NX with, e.g., 
        - fast drawing of arrows for large networks,
        - autoupdates when the user zooms in/out,
        - animations, 
        - editable plotting objects, 
        - plotly support
    - timing: Fabio example package in 1st qtr of 2025, followed by feedback, rewriting, integrating with NX, etc.
    - what questions/concerns/suggestions do we have for him?

-    Benchmarking CI job
      * nxbench https://github.com/dPys/nxbench/
      * action items:
          - comments/questions on work so far
          - get account access to hardware
              - Ross's racks?
              - github actions?
              - nvidia?
              - other options?
          - other items?
      * Keep in mind how to surface information from benchmarks to where that information makes a difference
- Updating the landing page 
    - translation should continue regardless of what theme we use as content should separate from theme.
    - What are next steps here if any?  
        - introduce Hugo theme to NX landing page
        - move to whatever myst theme the ecosystem moves to when it gets developed
        - translation should be able to happen anywhere along the way.

- [SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/)
    - "Note that endorsing doesn’t mean we have to implement or follow everything, just that we endorse and recommend this practice for the wider ecosystem. We may chose to not implement something because it doesn’t make sense for us."
    - [SPEC 7: pseudorandom handling](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0007/)
        - How does this handle default rngs?
            - [Dan] my understand is that `RandomState` is only needed when a "forever" bit stream must be guaranteed. So we need `rng=np.random.RandomState(42)` to work. But no other cases should use RandomState.
            - `default_rng` should be default. `int` should give `default_rng(int)`. If `Generator` or `RandomsState` instance, use it.
        - An understated part of this SPEC is that its implementation currently doesn't allow folks to use RandomState after the removal of the kwargs for randomstate.

- Visualization PRs:
    - [#7571 Saving layouts on the graph](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7571) (Needs Review)
    - [PR #7589 Introducing the new_draw API](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7589)
        - Separate old interface from new interface. But leave old in place. 
        - Ross provided a nice vision of the advantages of putting all the visualization data on the graphs. With this approach, there is a single object which controls all aspects that associate network features to the displayed content. The single object can then be passed into modules for drawing with graphviz, pydot, matplotlib, latex and text drawing functions. It also provides separation between drawing tools already provided by matplotlib (e.g. turning on the grid) from the information connected to the network (e.g. node_size). The lack of separation has sometimes led users to request pass-through functionality via keyword args.Ideally this new interface can avoid those functional bottlenecks.
        - Other names considered:
            - Proposal for the name `display`.
            - Could use `plot_network` (the choice of GraVe) 
            - `draw_nx`, `sketch`, `plot`, `show`, `new_draw`, `depict`, `see`, `viz`, `paint`, `display`, ~~`graph`~~, `visualize`, `render`, ...
            - We talked about the name `plot` being nice except that it is what matplotlib uses, and it has connotations of x-vs-y kinds of plots. `nxplot` could separate it from matplotlib. But it seems like `display` was a popular choice.

- `create_using` as hook for external graph implementations
    - TODO: write this as a mentorable project
    * If users have external `Graph` that implement the subset of methods necessary for various generators in NetworkX, they should be able to pass their class into `create_using` and get one of their objects out
        * See e.g. [#5762](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5672) for the random_graph generators. Merged :tada:
        - Supporting this adds a little boilerplate on NX's end; i.e. needing to check whether `create_using` is directed/multi for creation functions that don't support those types. Here's an [example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/409979eff35f02eff54f4eea3731736bd431dc2e/networkx/generators/classic.py#L547-L551). #5762 created a helper function [check_create_using](https://github.com/tillahoffmann/networkx/blob/b11c8fdd0934645c14ebe88b17f4b461d0e4b5e7/networkx/utils/misc.py#L604) in utils.py to do this processing so it is easy to implement across all random_graph.py functions.
        - Still need to:
          * wrap this boilerplate into a decorator similar to `not_implemented_for`.
          * Don't need to handle all of these in one giant PR! But maybe could... :)
- Should we raise a NetworkXError instead of a ValueError.
      - Should write that down somewhere (in developer guide?)
      - If error nx is creating, it's an NXError (vs SciPy, re-using ValueError, e.g.)
      - Some exceptions such as NodeNotFound, NXPointlessConcept etc (which is a very specific defined term that shouldn't easily be expanded)
- pygraphviz: Felipe from [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/pygraphviz-feedstock) has gotten us setup with `cibuildwheel` :rocket: 
  * Will merge after next pygraphviz release (early October)
  * Update?
- Tools:
    - Low priority update: typing
      - https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub
    - PyPy
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2259
        - PyPy 3.11 not available
            - https://github.com/pypy/pypy/milestone/15
    - ruff
        - "EM101",    # Exception must not use a string literal
        - "EM102",    # Exception must not use an f-string literal
        - "PD",       # pandas-vet
        - "NPY002",   # Replace legacy `np.random.random` call with `np.random.Generator`
        - Linting... is it still being applied to NetworkX in the CI? What is Ruff ignoring?
### Dispatch Topic
- Thoughts on [Issue #7623](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7623) to separate graph input validation from algorithms?
- [open dispatching PRs:](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ADispatching)
    - prioritized list from dispatch meeting: #7485 #7528 #7294 #7259.     There are more comments and info in the [dispatch meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/rqs_pWMxSLmICXCpI3w-Ug)
    - Merged [#7585](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7585)! :Tada:
- [SPEC 2 on Dispatching](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0002/) updated!! Thanks Aditi!!

## Collect Ideas for 4.0
- Should we start naming new modules with a leading underscore? This would simplify tab-completion by hiding modules.
- Restructure namespace: Review public interface: For v4.0 we should be looking at the import structure?  Some subpackages are not imported to the main namespace. We have decided that based on history of how they were first committed. Is there a good way to decide which should require an extra referal: `network.community.modularity` instead of `networkx.modularity`?
    - nx.dag might be a place to see how much churn  would entail.
  - First decision: what do we *want* the interface to be?
  - Module/pkg `__dir__` provides a nice way to modify discoverability of modules/packages **without** breaking existing code
  - NX-guide idea: model/visualize the package as a DAG (thanks Matt!)
- Generators revamp as per NXEP 3
  * [NXEP 3] Graph Builders and Generators (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/developer/nxeps/nxep-0003.rst)
    * [June 14] How to handle the docs for two functions nx.path_graph and nx.path_graph_generator
    * [June 14] Do we have a decorator create two functions in the main namespace? Or just hardcode the two functions in the module? Ideas on cutting down duplication of code/effort?
    * We should have a conversation about how dispatching should interact with these graph builders.
    * Rewritten Text merged! :tada: in [#6648](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6648)
    * Maybe make private functions that are generators. Could start now. Could be used to see how much impact it has on speed, memory use, etc. We can test it out privately and see what are the advantages. 
    * Motivation to make these changes for random graphs: [#5672](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5672) requests `create_using` arg for random graph generators so that subclass of Graph can be built by the generator
- Temporal Graphs
- Hyper Graphs
- Universal binary graph storage
    - Let's look at Arrow
    - Also look at binsparse
    - [Graphtool's binary format](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/gt_format.html)

### Possible (mentored) Projects
 
- To make contributions of new centrality algorithms more compelling, it would be helpful to have a large set of tests showing what are the expected values and how it is different from other measures of centrality. [add this discussion result to the contributors FAQ] (@rossbar)
- For centrality, a mentored project could test and document the various centrality measures and their differences on a suite of graphs. [add to list in the docs!]
- Visualization features/improvements
  * Marker intersection PR for drawing [#4601](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4601)

## NXEP Topics
  * We should create an NXEP describing dispatching.
  * Could we add the NXEP status to the documentation page with the list of NXEPs and their titles?  Maybe like: `NXEP 0 - Accepted - Purpose and process`. This might require changes to sphinx/autodoc. Any easy way to annotate within `index.rst` and still allow the autodoc links to be formed? 
  * According to NXEP 0 we should be converting NXEPs that are implemented to the status: Final...  not Accepted. Perhaps a PR to do that for 0, 1, 2 and 4 is in order. 
  * NXEP 4: TODO [name=rossbar] - propose acceptance on mailing list

## Long-term tracking items

  - let's collect a list(s) of network analysis problems that are really good, and that dispatch makes that possible to solve.
      - pypi connections of projects by requirements
      - tools to load datasets from a given url

- Landing Page Translation to multiple written languages. See [networkx-website 21](https://github.com/networkx/website/issues/21) 

- let's try to get a focused sprint for working on NetworkX in the next 4-12 months

- Org-level accounts on PyPi - we have applied, waiting to hear back

  * Submitted April 25, 2023, got confirmation. waiting for authorization. The ["about" item on the pypi organization page](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/) says the program is in "closed beta" at the moment.
  
- Revisiting our pytest `slow` mark: (from near the bottom of this document) 
  * The `slow` tests are run w/ each push/PR in the coverage job; however, it's not necessarily true that the slow tests improve coverage!
  * Could save a lot of CI time by having a separate category (e.g. `pytest.mark.comprehensive`?) that is for tests that are slow but *don't* affect coverage. These could be run less frequently (scheduled job?) and potentially save several minutes for each push
    - General consensus: seems like a good idea
- Other CI-saving ideas
    - All tests should depend on the lint action, so all the other tests fail fast.(Maybe only do this just before a sprint where many tasks could  jam up the CI.)

- nx pkg namesquatting on Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/nx/#description
  * TODO: https://github.com/pypi/support/issues - PEP 541
  * March 27, 2024: dschult emailed team@nx.pub to ask if they are willing to remove the package name from pypi, or transfer it to us.
  * Response: `Alex Doe <alexdoesh@gmail.com>
  * `Just in case, it’s not a name squatting or smth similar, I still work on a project (it’s a strict/static python aot compiler to webassembly, no interpreter) and hope to release it publicly this year. In case of inability to do so, I will notify you. Thank you and have a great day.`
  * So I think we should wait till 2025 and then contact again.

SPECS
-----
  - [SPEC 7: random seeding](https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/pull/180#issuecomment-1570678859)
    - We have NXEP-4 to discuss this https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/developer/nxeps/nxep-0004.html
    - Ross will review and coauthor SPEC 7
  
  - https://scientific-python.org/specs/
      - nx endorsed 0, 1, and 4
      - what about the [Accessibility SPEC 3?]( https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0003/) We support the accessibility goals and ideas, but most changes would need to be put in sphinx themes and other upstream tools. How do we support that and what would endorsing the SPEC mean for this topic?

  * TAMU sparse: http://sparse.tamu.edu/
    * Note: contains many SNAP datasets

- Do we have any info about what functions are most used/popular?
  * not from the survey - request for next iteration!
  * Guen (@guenp) is working with Matt (@mdhaber) on telemetry
  * We could look at networkx itself to see how often individual functions are called in the codebase itself
    * Jim Pivarski (@jpivarski) is working on a tool that would help with this at the May 2023 developer summit. Results?

- TODO from [igraph meeting](https://igraph.org/workshop.html) (June 21-22)
  - Group will be formed, e.g. "network science software sustainability group"
     * Convince other organizations/conferences to contribute to OSS Network software
  - Met graphtool dev, igraph devs, gephi
    * It'd be nice to have a list of github handles for folks from different communities
      - e.g. the gephi folks are GEXF experts, it'd be great to know who to ping!
  - Discussions on file format standarization for graph data (i.e. json-like)
  - Leiden is awesome
  - Basic dispatching discussion: topical discussion, folks are aware
  - More cross-community coordination to come!

- Teams Changes:
  - What else needs to be done with Teams changes? 
  Anybody else to add? Changes to "owners"?
    * 3 proposed teams [not agreed upon yet]:
      - maintainers (with commit rights)
      - triage (with triage rights)
      - emeritus (no active rights)
    * vs keep current teams and governance documents and just update the role for core developer from triage to write  [decided to switch to write access] Updated the core team too and removed emeritus owners.

- Adopt `pyproject.toml`?
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6774 (merged)
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6780 (merged)
  - https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/pull/471

- Best Practices for NX?
  - helpful to have a place for best-practices like nbunch, view vs dict, subgraph vs subgraph.copy()
  * nx-guides would be a good place for this!

- Keyword-only and maybe position-only input. Candidate subpackage to start changing code to keyword-only is the nx_pylab. (see [SLEP009](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep009/proposal.html) for how sklearn did this)

- We should try to automate the release process as much as possible so that we could remove a human from the release process. conda-forge has a very automated release system. Would a SPEC covering automated releases be reasonable?
    - Not clear what the advanatges of automating the release process would be. The process is [documented](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/developer/release.rst) What would make this better?
    - Why would automating things further not cause problems?
    - That's agree to make sure a PR's title is helpful and descriptive before merging it.

- VIZ keywords arrows, arrowstyle, connectionstyle. Can we improve this interface? [#5694](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5694) and a link to the [current interface](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/2c904d18dc79df3acd64495ef64c6ff4674992a0/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py#L537)
    - Now raise UserWarnings when users request features that are not available for the underlying edge-viz object (e.g. LineCollection)
    - Is there a better, more wholistic solution?
    - Need to indicate:
      o FancyArrowPatch or LineCollection
      o The arrowstyle (head or not or both, etc)
      o The connectionstyle (arc bendable etc)
    - Maybe changing the name of `arrows` to `fancyedges` would help
    - New logic could be:  If non-default value for either arrowstyle or connectionstyle then switch to FancyArrowPatch.

- Property-based testing
  * Check out `hypothesis` for setting up property-based testing
  * Developing good property-based tests:
    - Reference "naive" (but correct) implementation
    - Generate random graphs, evaluate them for the property you want
    - Pump these through the naive implementation and collect interesting cases for test suite

- Temporal networks: how to think about these
  * seems to be a lot of interest from different communities, but no standard approach yet...
  * Having a use-case to drive the design of a data structure would be good
  
- nx-guides
  * We need a contributor guide :book: [name=Mridul]
  * Dependency management for tutorials - how to strike a balance between tools people use and maintainability

- New contributors
  * So many good students/contributions - how do we keep the ball rolling (even if we can only accept 1 or a subset of them for this round)
    - Add something to contributor guide about where to look for good issues (e.g. add missing docstring examples)
    - Link to [first issue tag](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/labels/Good%20First%20Issue) on github?
