### Action Items
- Fabio Zanini has created `iplotx` a package to unify network plotting between igraph and networkx (and possibly future other packages). We discussed this back in January. Currently all igraph and networkx drawing unit tests passing and he has started building a gallery of examples taking from both packages.
    - https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx
    - Examples:
        - A [somewhat complex example](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/plot_complex.html)
        - [A simple side to side comparison](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/plot_parallel_igraph_networkx.html#sphx-glr-gallery-plot-parallel-igraph-networkx-py) of igraph and networkx usage for a concrete example.
        - [The current gallery of plots](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html)
    - The documentation is still scant and especially there is little mention yet as of:
         - how to use styles, which are the core element to change appearance of things declaratively
        - how to explore the custom matplotlib subclasses, which are the core elements to edit behaviour at a deeper level (e.g. interactive GUIs, redraws, animations)
    - Feedback is requested. Fabio says:
        - There are a few known bugs with bezier derivatives and whatnot but I am hoping it's on the right track. Of course lots of credit to networkx folks, that's the beauty of open source!
    - Some feedback:
        - The self-loops look better!
        - The syntax makes use of the style elements being stored on the graph. At least if they are on the graph it makes the syntax easy to point to them. It also looks like storing them separately from the graph works too. 
        - Let's check how storing style elements as arrays also works (old style drawing).
        - Let's take a look at the style system presented. Would it make sense to have default ways to look up values that are not assigned in the style dict?
        - Are there other aspects of drawing we would want to include? 
- release 3.5 has occured!
- Webpage and translations: Jarrod held off from updating the webpage though. He says "But the translations on the main page look like they are going to make releases more difficult if we want to keep the translations up to date." Where do we stand on this issue? Are there discussions on the website repo PRs or Issues that discuss how to update the webpages?
    - Jarrod updated the webpage to v3.5 without the translations.
    - Let's continue the discussion of how to maintain translations. Numpy has English for v2.2 while translations are only for v1.26.

## Topics
- ordered nodes, and a clearly stated contract about ordered nodes. [PR 8071](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8071) and many others. 
    - one motivating issue from `optimize_edit_paths` [Issue 8054](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8054)
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc). 
- chordal graphs, elimination orders, etc.
    - what is alpha used for other than an ordering. Why not return a list for the ordering?
