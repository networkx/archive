**In attendance**: Dan, Rick, Ross

## Misc stuff (notes from todays meeting)
- next summit? when(maybe late spring?), where(maybe east coast -- and save So. Cal for winter), topics(better when we have topics that we have done work on before the meeting--like with free-threading and release process/permission for Nov 5, 2025 summit)
- pygraphviz windows wheels checkup
- let's make random_paths funct private.
- make multiple walks be done by the user in a generator. make multiple starting nodes be done by the user in a generator. (simplest api for "inner walk finding" function)
- Rick pointed to the [graph-walker](https://github.com/kerighan/graph-walker/blob/master/README.md) built on networkx as a simple interface to many walk-related tools.

## Topics
- `random_walk`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8383
  * What should behavior be?
    - What happens when walk is deterministic (e.g. directed path) and terminates before `walk_length`?
    - How to handle `nodes`
      * Seems to be consolidating support behind the None, subset, single node support
    - What about a probabilistic walk termination, e.g. a 0.1 chance that the walk is terminated at each step?
    - Weighted walks with `random.choices(weight=)` - does nx random mechanism support?
      * TODO: Can we get to something like node2vec using weight callable?

- `_build_paths_from_predecessors`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8460
  * Both existing and proposed implementations are hard to understand
    - Can we use dict.popitem to implement LIFO?
    
- Re-use of intermediate computations - general approach/policy?
  * e.g. re-using shortest paths dict in closeness_centrality: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8424
  * Other places where this is already done:
    - Re-using eccentricity in other distance_measures

- Linting 1: any objections to updating linter versions?
  * Tried last night, doesn't change code
  * Can do so with `pre-commit autoupdate` if we're okay using versions instead of hashes
  
- Linting 2: Enforce `pytest.raises` as context manager?
  * Ruff rule for this: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/legacy-form-pytest-raises/
  
- API: Do we want to add `centroid` as an alias to `barycenter` in `distance_measures`?
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8491

- Rich club: how to handle normalization: 
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/8485
  * Side quest: is there a closed-form solution or approximation for number of non-isomorphic graphs with given degree sequence?
  
- `bfs_predecessors`: consider deprecating?
  * 
  * Confusing name (see https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8445)
  * One-liner otherwise
  * Not used in rest of library
  * Picture less clear for `bfs_successors`

- Other doc issues: [Football gallery example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8419)
  - Link to football data is kaput; can we intern/mirror it?

- Refactor nx.draw to [use display under-the-hood PR 8255](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8255)
    - run drawing heavy suites from outside the tests:
        - gallery
        - nx-guides
        
- Probably should Update docs to point to iplotx and/or display as needed. (Action: open an issue)

### Action Items
- We should help out contributors who have a single function optimization for their use-case. Probably by making backends with one function easy to use/share/morph.
- `iplotx` (Fabio Zanini [package for drawing igraph and NetworkX graphs](https://github.com/fabilab/iplotx)) 
    - [Gallery](https://iplotx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) 


## Old Topics
- Benchmarking: Building off what Derek put together.
    - pytest.benchmark vs asv for benchmarks? Are there better tools. 
        - What did Derek use in the end? Are there tools within that we could build on.
    - Three aspects to benchmarking:
        - presentation of results
        - running and data storage (ascii/csv/json, etc)
        - authoring (which datasets as well as parameters of the functions)
    - Can we put together a set of functions and datasets?
        - Create a NetworkX suite of graph benchmarks
