### Action Items
- release 3.5?
    - Check pydot release from 3.0 to 4.0. It broke some stuff. We should check that we have that all working.
        - This is now OK (we have merged PR 8027) for pydot versions 3 and 4.
    - No other PRs are scheduled to go in for this release.

## Topics
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.
    - Would be used by arrangoDB and nx-cugraph
    - if its useful for backend users/consumers and it doesn't impact other users (opt-in, etc). 
- `is_aperiodic` semantics
  * Connected components, self loops
    - [PR 8021](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/8021) some broken aspects of `is_aperiodic`.  Looks like decision is to only allow this function for stronly connected graphs. Then use docs to show how it would work for single attracting component systems (get the attracting component and run this function on that).
- chordal graphs, elimination orders, etc.
    - what is alkpha used for other than an ordering. Why not return a list for the ordering?
